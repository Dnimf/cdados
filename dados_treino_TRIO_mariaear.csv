"The force holding the cars up is friction. Any object traveling in a circle is accelerating towards the center of the circle, so the car is pressed into the wall (it would fly off in a straight line if the wall disappeared, and each point on the wall ahead of the car is slightly closer to the center of the circle relative to the trajectory of the car at any point, so the car is constantly pushed towards the center as it moves forward). The pressure into the wall creates static friction with the wheels (point of contact of a moving tire is stationary) which provides an upwards force against gravity. The wall is also slanted, so the wall itself provides some force upward on the car due to gravity, adding even more to the friction force.  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/inclined-planes-friction/v/static-and-kinetic-friction-example  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/centripetal-force-and-gravitation/centripetal-forces/a/what-is-centripetal-force",Physics

"Yeah, that’s what I was mainly talking about too. Did you read my post past the first example? It applies about the same for flue streams as it does to atmospheric CO2, which is why I brought it up. The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. \n\n(If you just feel like skimming the rest of this, see the paragraphs I say are the most important one. It provides links to journal articles which directly address what thermodynamic processes are important in determining the limits of direct air capture. One passage from one of the journal articles directly addresses and contradicts your claim.)\n\nDo you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coal/natural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you’re making? Process chemistry analysis of the feasibility of carbon capture is done on all of these different capture environments. Have these people missed out on the apparent massive flaw in direct air capture? If you read such a paper, it even talks about energy requirements and related concerns for carbon capture. A conclusion you won’t find in this analysis is that “carbon capture is pointless because the energy required to capture the carbon is too high.” You can read this article (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.00092/full). Note the following quotation “Based on these studies, DAC is currently considered as an energy-intensive and costly approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, researchers believe that the high cost and energy consumption in such systems are mostly due to the immaturity of the technology, and hence DAC may be eventually considered as a viable option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.” There’s no suggestion that DAC is futile because of thermodynamics restrictions. Perhaps you have a reservation about this journal (I know it’s maybe a little controversial - my main experience with it has been with a very high quality review article I read in it on a different topic though), in which case I’m sure you can find other articles on this topic in other journals, although the corresponding author’s google scholar looks legitimate enough. \n\n(These next 2 paragraphs are the most important part of my reply)\n\nYou can also check out (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00173) which is a very well cited review on direct air capture. They even have a thermodynamics section toward the end. Note that they even mention the second law of thermodynamics, but the process they are applying it to is CO2 binding to the adsorbent and then having it unbind. Citation 28 of that paper directly addresses a theoretical lower bound for the energy requirements in section 2.1. Here’s a link for a pdf of it. (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/document) The paragraphs at the start of section 2 explain how the relevant thermodynamic process doesn’t involve whatever it was that initially put the CO2 there, but rather have to do with adsorption and desorption from the material. Note how they don’t even mention the source of the CO2 in the atmosphere. \n\nThat article in citation 28 even has this quotation “The ∼4 GJ/tC minimum may be compared to the carbon-specific energy content of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas have about 40, 50, and 70 GJ/tC respectively. Thus if the energy for air capture is provided by fossil fuels then the amount of carbon captured from the air can—in principle—be much larger than the carbon content of the fuel used to capture it. The fuel carbon can, of course, be captured as part of the process rather than being emitted to the air.” This directly shows that your claim is incorrect. \n\nI’m not trying to be argumentative for its own sake; your claim sounded intuitive enough that I figured people might read it, think it sounded right, and then move on with a very misinformed opinion on direct air capture. In another thread on this subreddit I even saw a similar claim to the one you made being made, so it seems like others find this type of argument compelling, but I’m not sure where it’s coming from. \n\nRegarding your other point, I don’t understand why the main thing you responded to had to do with the greenhouse effect either. Obviously CO2 is a greenhouse gas. My point was that the CO2 that gets captured may or may not be in an excited vibrational state when it gets captured. Ultimately, it doesn’t even matter for the rest of the argument though. The 2 main paragraphs above show that your thermodynamic argument is incorrect with peer-reviewed journal articles.",Physics

"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics

Oh yes of course! I was just pointing out that the basic framework for what dark matter would be (such as a weakly interacting massive particle) is super mundane and well understood.

Draw 5 boxes (to represent the 5 d orbitals, assuming all are equivalent energy), put one up arrow (one electron in each one, that's one of the rules above mentioned) you have one electron left, so it has to pair up in one of those orbitals.\n\nSo for subsequent oxidation states, can you think of any sensible oxidations to have a nice number of electrons filling those orbitals?\n\nA +3 OS would have 3d5 electrons, ie, one in each orbital.\n\nThis is why +3 is common for Fe.\n\nIt's not a perfect rule, but it will do for your understanding.\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Block/3_d-Block_Elements/1b_Properties_of_Transition_Metals/Oxidation_States_of_Transition_Metals\n\nNow you could just memorise that almost all transition metals are going to be +2 and +3 (except Cu, which you can work out from assessing it's Valence electrons).\n\nAnother alternative: understand the underlying chemistry and work out the oxidation state.\n\nIt's a lot easier to memorise the anion oxidation state (eg O is almost always 2-, halogens 1-, etc. The common anions as well are easy to remember.

"To make it easier to see that the center ring is indeed an 18 electron system, pretend the benzene rings don't exist and assign electron counts to the atoms and charges in the central main ring then add them. eg. C and N are 1 each [as long as the Nitrogen is not connected to more than 2 atoms in a ring system other than the outward pointing R groups eg. in quinozolium the Nitrogen counts as 2 electrons] and every excess electron in the negatively charged ring is 1 each. There are 6 Nitrogens, 2 extra electrons and 10 Carbons which sums to 6 + 2 + 10 = 18.\n\nAnother way is to again, erase the benzene rings and draw the center ring without them attached. You'll end up with 7 double bonds and 2 amine like Nitrogens in one of the resonance structures that you can draw. Each double bond counts as 2 electrons and each amine like Nitrogen also counts as 2 which results in a total count of 7 x 2 + 2 x 2 = 18.\n\nWhile the benzene rings do interact and share electron density with the central ring, for most purposes they can be treated as separate ring systems.",Chemistry

Pretty much everyone has electricity available at home, even in pretty rural areas. There is almost no infrastructure for hydrogen anywhere.\n\nThat being said, hydrogen production may become more significant over the coming decades, but probably not for use in fuel cells.

"Consider any point along the rope. The question now is, how is air resistance and gravity affecting the rope beneath it? That determines in which direction the rope beneath that point is pulling that point on the rope.\n\nWell, gravity is proportional to the mass of that length of rope, which is proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nAir resistance is proportional to the wind-facing surface area of the rope, which is *also* proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nSince these are both proportional to length, as you move down the rope, neither the downward effect of gravity or the approximately horizontal effect of air resistance is able to pull ahead, and the rope is just pulled in the same direction for the entire length.\n\n----\n\nHere is a more mathematically rigorous explanation:\n\nConsider an arbitrary length of the rope.\n\nIgnoring other attached segments of rope (which should behave identically), and thus their tension forces, there are two forces acting on the rope: gravity, and air resistance.\n\nNet air resistance is proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's wind-facing area is proportional to its length.\n\nNet gravitational force is *also* proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's mass is proportional to its length.\n\nThus, the net force is given by:\n\n- **F**_net = **F**_a + **F**_g = L\***f**_a + L\***f**_g = L\*(**f**_a + **f**_g)\n\nwhere **F**_a and **F**_g are air resist. and gravity, L is rope length, and **f**_a and **f**_g are the ""per-length"" air resist. and gravity forces.\n\nSince the rope is of uniform mass, **f**_g is constant for the entire rope, since gravity is approximately constant along the whole rope, which is short compared to the size of the Earth.\n\nIf we assume approximately constant air velocity and air density/makeup around the entire length of the rope, then we also get that **f**_a is constant for the entire rope.\n\nSince **f**_a and **f**_g are constant for the whole rope, so is there sum. This means that we have:\n\n- **F**_net = L\***k**\n\nwhere **k** = **f**_a + **f**_g is a constant vector.\n\nAll this math has resulted in the above equation, which alone tells us the rope should be straight and look like (B). The net force for every segment of rope along the rope, before accounting for tension forces, is in the same direction. When you add tension forces, those will only act parallel or anti-parallel to this net force.\n\nThus, the net force along the entire rope will be parallel to a constant direction, which is a straight line.",Physics

"From Wikipedia:\n\nIn general, glycerophospholipids use a ""sn"" notation, which stands for stereospecific numbering.[5] When the letters ""sn"" appear in the nomenclature, by convention the hydroxyl group of the second carbon of glycerol (2-sn) is on the left on a Fischer projection. The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry

Even with the lights on, these objects would be ""invisible"" in the sense that they would reflect almost no light (it would be easy to see them if they were silhouetted against non-blacked out objects, however).

So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here.

"Antimatter: there are tons of high precision measurements with muons, pions, Ws, electrons, kaons, and many other particles where we can measure and differentiate particles from antiparticles and measure their properties to be consistent, up to CPV.\n\nAs far as explaining oscillations to non experts, I have tried numerous different approaches, studied what other communicators do, and followed up with non physicists who read/listened to a discussion of oscillations afterwards. And basically none of the descriptions really sink in. The problem, of course, is that it is a fundamentally QM process with no classical analog. So it's better to at least use the right words so people can connect what they're reading here with what they've read and heard elsewhere. And it's not like oscillations is a unfamiliar word.\n\nThe fact that neutrinos oscillate implies that there are almost certainly sterile neutrinos; the presence of a 1 eV sterile or not does not change that. And sure, leptogenesis could be the answer to BAU, but nothing that any neutrino experiment can measure can tell us one way or another.\n\nYour points are well taken though.",Physics

"Not really. The vast majority of the physics we know today comes from experimental data analysis first.\n\nThis doesn't mean that we only add random parameters but the first stage in writing new physics is describing the phenomenon and make the math work. Then afterwards you can prove a more comprehensive theory that gives you the intial explanation as a result and that hopefully has some observable aspects that can help you verify it is actually correct.\n\nThis is not a ""new"" thing, the evolution from just describing motion to Newtonian physics to only afterwards the Hamiltonian equation is an example. Or Bohr and Planck ""inventing"" discrete energy and angular momentum before quantum mechanics was a thing to explain some experiments.\n\nAnd after you've done all this you still have to verify with experiments that you theory is correct. You could potentially have you hundreds of different theories that all give you the known physics as limit cases but still are fundamentally different, you can't just choose one unless it is able to predict something you can't already explain. And right now that's difficult because experiments going beyond the known phenomenons would cost trillion of dollars.

"I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions.

The x-axis is the scale factor which is related to time; the right side is today, the left side was a long time ago. The y-axis is the fractional energy density. Don't worry about the different line styles, they are details of the specific model in this paper. But in general we see that the universe used to be radiation dominated (teal), but radiation redshifts away very quickly and its energy density goes like a^-4 . Next we have a matter^1 (brown) dominated region since its energy density decreases only like a^-3 . But there is also dark energy (purple) whose energy density remains constant in time: a^0 . So it was always there but when you realize the x-axis is logarithmic, it isn't surprising that each one turns on/off fairly suddenly.\n\nAs for the future, see LSST now VRO, their physics cases are outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366).

This could be due to experimental error, or a 1% branching ratio to some exotic decay channel. This result doesn’t help resolve this puzzle.\n\nImproved precision helps probe CKM unitarity.

"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what’s actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it’s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we’re not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket’s increasing power given by F x V.",Physics

"You make some good points, but I think it’s important to recognize that carbon capture companies that sequester their carbon rather than using it for energy would be making money primarily via government funding. \n\nYes, they could in principle come to rely on there being more CO2 emitted so that it was worth it for the plant to be functioning, but this would only be an issue if the government was unable to pass laws that required a switch to clean energy. You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn’t pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it’s important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don’t think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.",Physics

"As I learned from Carl Sagan, we can't comprehend 4D, but we can calculate it's ""shadow."" \n\nFor example, a creature in Flat Land that can only experience 2 dimensions will not be able to comprehend a cube, BUT, it CAN comprehend the SHADOW of the cube as projected onto its 2D world. From the creature's point of view, the object is not a collection of equal sides and angles, like a cube is supposed to be, but rather, the creature sees two differently sized squares linked together (just like a drawing of a cube).  \n\nLike the creature, we cannot see or comprehend a cube in the 4th dimension, but we can comprehend its shadow as projected onto our 3D world. A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience. You're right in that we can calculate these 4th dimensional objects and possibly insert them into a virtual reality code, but all we would be able to see are the ""shadows"" of the objects, like the 3D representation of a tesseract.\n\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/55433/in-what-sense-is-a-tesseract-shown-4-dimensional",Physics

"I am increasingly interested in the prospect of going after a PhD in Switzerland or Germany. For the record, I have a M.S. in chemistry and the idea of a shorter PhD sounds appealing to me, especially given that I just entered my 30s. I look at various places and wonder how hard it would be to make this happen. For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.  \n  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment? Should I just reach out to random graduate students/advisors and ask them about their research or does it just seem like such a pie-in the sky question to ask that a graduate student or advisor may even chuckle at my inquiry?",Chemistry

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management. Hours will depend on the company culture - some of my US colleagues work quite long days, but on the whole it's likely to be less hours than a PhD.",Chemistry

"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

"Hi everyone! I'm not a STEM student but I've spent a great deal of time reading physics textbooks and watching Walter Lewin's lectures. I went over a great deal of concepts (classical mechanics and most of electromagnetism that you would find in a college textbook).  \nNow that I'm working full-time, I need to find a time-efficient resource to focus on understanding how things work on a fundamental level. The problem with college textbooks and videos is that they are quite time intensive, I would like something that just explains concepts and formula, making it simple and intuitive through the use of analogy. This way I can just spend not so long on absorbing new contents and spend more time about thinking how to use these formula to solve real life problem. I'm not trying to take exams, just trying to understand how The Universe works to help me think through things and learn circuit and electronics (don't want to learn only that though, I want to learn everything that undergraduate are learning).

"Ignoring the possibility of new physics, the variance is mostly driven by two things: possible experimental error, and statistical fluctuations. If this experiment was 10x efficient ~~and~~ at transporting the UCN from the source to the trap then the total uncertainty would likely be around 0.1 s instead of 0.3 s.\n\n> Doesn't this indicate that a good area to probe would be whatever external influence was cut out that allowed the estimate to be 2 times more precise than before?\n\nThat was just driven by having more neutrons than previous experiments, so we could do the measurement to a higher precision.

"First: There is a difference between ""natural occurring nuclides"" and ""primordial nuclides"". Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though!

So you can swap the ""colour label"" between particles/quarks and the system is invariant. This is the essence of symmetry.\n\nEdit:\nI took a quick glimpse at the QCD Lagrangian, and I think that two quarks with equal colour state experience a different interaction than two quarks with different colours.

"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air’s volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate’s downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air’s acceleration along the escape path. The air’s inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate’s downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it’s on a more pronounced “air cushion” but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air’s pressure to remain high. Now that the plate’s weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it “slides downhill” on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate’s slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics

"Neutrons decay by emitting a Beta particle (electron) and a neutrino and end up as a proton (there’s a bit more that happens under the hood with quarks, but from the outside looking in this is the end product).  As a free particle, a neutron has more energy than a proton, electron, and neutrino combined.  This means that the neutron will tend to go to a lower energy state by changing into a proton.\n\nIn a nucleus, a neutron has the same potential energy as before, but now there are other positive particles nearby - protons.  To turn into a proton while surrounded by protons requires energy: the same energy as bringing a proton to the nucleus from infinitely far.  In stable nuclei, this requires more energy than would be released by the neutron during decay.  Therefore the event is exceptionally rare or practically never happens.  It’s as if the surrounding protons are gatekeeping the neutron and not allowing it to decay.\n\nIn some larger nuclei, where there are a lot of neutrons relative to protons, there aren’t as many protons to repel the potential new proton and more surrounding neutrons with favorable binding energy through the strong nuclear force.  These nuclei do have neutrons decay into protons through beta decay.",Physics

From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs.

"Here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n““>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

"Observing IS interacting! There is no way to measure the result of the experiment without interacting with the wave. I believe the use of the word “observing” with quantum experiments is really misleading. There is nothing special about us that changes quantum behavior by consciously observing the experiment - ANY interaction between waves will cause it to collapse, regardless of whether we see it happen or not. If a photon impacts a mote of dust in the atmosphere and scatters, did its wave not collapse at the moment it collided just because no one was around to see it happen? \n\nIf you shoot electrons through a double slit onto an electron detector with your eyes closed and don’t look at the results, the interference pattern will still be on the detector. Observer or no observer, the electrons still collapse onto the detector in the same way. \n\nObserving is simply the conscious recording of an interaction - it is the interaction that causes the wave to collapse, not the observation.",Physics

The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.",Chemistry

"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics

"I mean, you could always make your own standard. If you're confident you have extremely high purity salt to begin with (KCl for example), you would need a very precise mass of salt and a very accurate volume/mass of 18.2 MO water (pretty common in echem labs).\n\nIt's all about how confident you are about the [Cl-] in your solution. Also about how confident you are that there isn't anything else in solution that behaves like Cl- (IIRC F- can interfere with chloride ISEs, don't quote me on that though).\n\nSo ultimately, if you can make it yourself and are confident in the purity of KCl / DI water you're using, I don't see why not. Bear in mind you'll probably have to re-make the standard (the shelf life won't be great) between experiments depending on usage.\n\nDefinitely calculate and propagate the error if you serial dilute to make a calibration curve.\n\nIMO it depends on whether you need the certifications that come with buying the standards / what kind of experiment you want to perform.",Chemistry

"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell.

"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

"I found this on the World Wide Web:\n\nNo shape can “amplify” sound.\n\nSound being a pressure wave in air, it has a fixed energy, which dissipates with distance from the source.\n\nIf you want to maximise the amount of that energy you capture, a parabolic dish can focus that energy down to a point, which has the effect of concentrating it there. The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a “beam” of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it’s coupled poorly to the air, it won’t produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not “amplify”, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.\n\nby Graham Cox, BSc (hons) from University of East Anglia (1993)",Physics

Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

This coefficient varies depending on the material, and means of heat transfer (conduction, convection, or radiation).",Chemistry

And even the standard clocks in different national laboratories are not in exactly the same gravitational potential. Therefore for realization of a practically useful time standard, such as [International Atomic Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time), the relativistic corrections are necessary. The second of International Atomic Time is defined at the gravitational potential of the mean sea level.

"There are 4 effects at play here.\n\nNote, most times mixing a strong base and vinegar most times achieves nothing other than making fizzy water.\n\nFirst: a process called ""salting out"".  Add a pinch of ordinary table salt to acrylic paints and it will destabilize, separate and you get a clear layer of water on top of thick sludge.  Analogy is you have a stable positive magnet floating and then you toss a whole bunch of negative magnets to make it crash.  Most polymers are stable only at certain controlled ionic balances.  Some stains work by sticking really tightly to the surface of a material, almost like a magnet or velcro.  Stain()+ <---> (-)fibre.   Blood, some paints, protein and a few others.  Adding a whole bunch of salt overwhelms any ionic interactions and disrupts the intermolecular interactions bonds so you end up with stain.Cl and fibre.Na.  The stain material just falls off.\n\nSecond: Vinegar that has been neutralized or in the acetate form is very good at ""chelating"" calcium compounds.  Your acrylic paint probably contains about 20% calcite (chalk) as a filler.  By using the acetate ion you remove the calcite, which loosens all the paint.\n\nThird: pH effects.  The acrylic latex usually contains a lot of acid functional groups from acrylic acid polymers.  When you add ammonia it can make the polymer soften.  Tough to explain the chemical theory, but acrylic polymers change hardness (glass transition) by a lot depending if they are at high or low pH (ionic or neutral acid form).  As the ammonia evaporates your solution pH will also drop.  By swapping pH you are doing the chemical equivalent of pushing it backwards and forwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForth: salt is a mild abrasive.  You effectively sand papered off the top layer of your clothing.  This is basis for the product Barkeepers Friend or Jiff.  Magic eraser would have the same effect.",Chemistry

During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.)

"Many molecules have chains of atoms, including almost all organic compounds like gasoline, sugar, proteins, etc.  \nThe central atom concept applies to each of the atoms in the chain, as a way to explain their geometries. For example, the molecule acetic acid (the sour part of vinegar) is C2H4O2. On one of the C atoms there are three H atoms and then the next C along. The four bonds around that carbon predict a geometry where the angles are roughly 109.5 degrees- the “tetrahedral” shape. Then the other C has a three bonds: one from the first C, a (double) bond to one of the oxygen atoms, and a bond to the second oxygen. With three bonds we’ll say the best geometry is planar, with the bonds at 120 degree angles. Finally that second oxygen has the bond to the H atom, plus non-bonding electron pairs.    \nSo even that simple molecule can be thought of as having 3 “central” atoms.",Chemistry

Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to.

With your eyes open you can see its a continuous wave propagating throughout the surface of the pond. But if you close your eyes, and put your finger just over the waters surface so that the wave barely touches it as it passes, would you still be able to tell it was a wave and not a single drop of water touching your finger?

"to be honest I dont agree. Using gloves only when they are necessary is more advisable I think (of course you need to know when you need them and learning to be aware of possible dangers is worth a lot). A lot of stuff in the lab, especially teaching labs, is not more dangerous than stuff that is commonly used at home, it is important to differentiate. Also if people wear gloves they tend to care a lot less if they spill something or not and if they do, they contaminate everything instead of cleaning the mess up immediately. Wearing gloves for a prolonged amount of time also causes sweating and opens the pores, which makes the exposure to chemicals even more dangerous and guess what, gloves also have a time limit on how long they guarantee to withstand different chemicals and people also tend to not care about that and wear gloves for hours.\n\nOf course I dont want to abolish gloves, but I think brainless overuse causes more harm, than it does good.

"Short answer stick to cs and there are plenty of cs jobs in healthcare, unless you specifically want to go MD. \n\nChemistry or especiallh biology is, unfortunately still largely a black box and there's little logic behind any of them. There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it. The most math intensive thing in benchtop chemistry or biology is deriving ratios for buffer and REPEATING it many times. On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization. Ive done 300 level biochemistry and had became a ta in that course involuntarily in grad school and it's all about memorization of stupid cycles that nobody cares. At least you'd imagine they'd teach you how that cycle is logically discovered, but fuck no.\n\nAlso be warned a typical Chem or bio graduate has nothing to do with healthcare. The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do. Buy them a lunch and they will tell you their childhood secrets along with it, it works just that wonderfully.",Chemistry

My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future. But that's not the world we live in.",Chemistry

"> How do I look for groups in a specific research area?\n\nOnce you start reading papers about a specific subject, you will naturally start to recognise familiar names and places. Perhaps a good starting point if you're completely unfamiliar with the landscape of a particular subfield is to go to a Wikipedia page for a topic you're interested in, look for the sources they cite and who has recently cited those papers.\n\n> Once I know the groups which appeal to me, should I just look if they have an open PhD position? Or should I look more in general? If so, how would you suggest I look for a PhD?\n\nFrom my experience, most PhD positions in Europe are not advertised openly because there are suitable candidates inside the research group (a big exception to this are larger research centres like Max Planck institutes which have a regular rate of many PhD positions each year). My advice is to a) ask your master thesis advisor (ideally you want to do your thesis on a related subject although that's rarely a deal-breaker) and b) contact professors from research groups you're interested in early on (at least 9 to 6 months before you plan on graduating, because securing funding takes quite long and will not unlikely get you involved in writing a grant application).",Physics

"My brother is the nuclear engineer so I know more than the average chemist but I'm no expert. I'm still reasonably certain that this is wrong. You don't really input energy into a nuclear reactor. You have fuel rods that will always and constantly give off neutrons. You use neutron moderators, usually coolant as water, to thermalize the neutrons and slow them down. Slower neutrons are more likely to collide with uranium for more reactions. Then you use reflectors and absorbers like beryllium and boron, respectively, to control how many neutrons there are around the fuel rods. At no point did I have to input any energy to cause the uranium to decay and give off neutrons. It's just doing what it would do anyways, and I'm controlling it with external factors. \n\nSo from that standpoint, I think the key things for the chemistry of your fuel rods are factors like density of your actual fuel (ie crystal structure), it's propensity to form cracks during it's lifetime, thermal expansion, etc etc. Even if this couterion neutron capture is an issue, I think it would take a back seat to the other factors and be relatively minor.

"The other comment provides a few of the physical explanations explaining the discrepancies, but the main idea is that bottle-type (this experiment) measures the neutron before they decay, and the beam-type experiments measure the products of the decay (proton and electron).

If however there's another mechanism for it to decay through, e.g. dark matter, then the two values would differ in the way that they actually do with bottle-types consistently measuring shorter half-lives.",Physics

"Disclaimer: You are taking the very first steps of a very long road thrilled by many physicists, many of them never accepted Quantum Mecanics as a physical theory.\n\nYour thought experiment were in fact already executed several times and in different situations. There are a lot of underlying conditions you may be missing, I will give you some food for thought:\n1) Under Quantum Mechanics formalism (QM), energy conservation is not to be understood in the same way you may have under Classical Mechanics. The most striking example of this is the tunneling of particles through a potential greater than its total mechanical energy. But this is not the only one. See the Casimir force, for example;\n2) In your setup, you are probably taking your 'detectors' as perfect ones, which never miss any detection and does not give false positive. Even in a thought experiment, it is hard to conciliate this with QM formalism. Either way, supposing you have one, you are entering the 'spooky action at distance'. See the debate between Einstein and Bohr on this subject, where Einstein states what was later known as EPR paradox. I consider this a very important criticism because - although Einstein were proved wrong at the end, its questioning gave rise to a whole new field of QM, known as the QM contextuality. The first concise steps in this new field were given by Bell, which stated his famous 'inequality', I suggest you to have a try on this too;\n3) The true answer to your question is: the speed at which this 'information of detection' should travel is not relevant. What is known is that it happens as long as you adquire information about the system, you have your 'colapse'. Also, it does not violate classical energy conservation, because in the long run, i.e., in the limit where you have a long enough number of trials, total energy will be conserved. If you search for the arguments and references I've mentioned in step 2, you will inevitably end in the so called 'Hidden Variables Theory', which is in fact the begining of the contextuality problem.",Physics

"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics
"Every morning I wake up, hang around my house and wait for the coffee and edibles to kick in, and I wander into work at some point with no one really checking on when I get there or when I leave and I check my email to see if there are any fires I need to put out or someone whining about wanting their data. I make a to-do list for the day, plan what I'm going to do in lab, toss some headphones on and do it, yell at our piece of shit equipment/instruments, do some paperwork, and go home when I'm finished with what I need to do for that day to not be screwed the next day, which depending on the day can be as short as 5 hours or as long as 16. \n\nI get home and if my girlfriend is still awake I'll complain to her about things she doesn't totally understand while she politely says ""that sucks, why don't they get better machines"".

My parent are generally proud of me and stopped asking if I had considered changing course and going to med school about 6 years into my career, but it was a fair question to ask back then since I had gotten through college with a smart-sounding major and had a hilariously low salary. The money improved over time, and I'm happy with it, but there was a decent amount of time where I was questioning my life decisions pretty hard. \n\nI'd make more money with probably about the same amount of effort if I went into medicine, and sometimes I wish I would have done that since the older I get the more I appreciate being comfortable and the idea of being able to retire early, but I don't think I'm the kind of person who would have thrived in that environment and this line of work vibes with my personality and skillset (detail oriented, steady hands, good at abusing amphetamines) a lot more. \n\ntldr: Being a chemist is pretty okay I guess",Chemistry

">To address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. \n\nA slight correction to this -- the CO2 doesn't really *re-emit* the photon.  Instead the absorbed photon excites the ro-vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, effectively increasing its kinetic energy, which is then re-distributed to other molecules (such as N2, O2, H2O) in the atmosphere upon collisions, effectively leading to increased kinetic energy content (=temperature) of the atmosphere.  This difference in the process is crucial for understanding the fine details of the greenhouse effect; however, it is almost trivial at the same time, given that the black-body radiation (mostly IR for something at \~300K) of a substance is temperature-dependent.",Physics

"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry.

"In Quantum Chromodynamics there is a concept known as Charge-Parity Symmetry.\n\nYou may have heard of an antiparticle?\n\nExperiments show that the laws of physics are the exact same for an electron moving forwards as an antielectron moving backwards.\n\nThe thing is, there's no reason for this observed symmetry based on anything we know. To explain this apparent CP symmetry, we invented a new particle axion.\n\nThis is a similar reason to why the Higgs particle was added. Something needed to do something to match our model with what we observe. We later discovered the particle and it turns out our model still works pretty well.",Physics

"So it sounds like your less confused about why it's exothermic and more confused about how a metastable system can change phase exothermically. But the thermodynamics doesn't care. Thermodynamics only states how energy will change eventually, there's absolutely no timeline on that change. In other words, thermodynamics states that when the solution crystallizes, it will be exothermic by X amount. That could happen immediately if you cool it too fast and don't achieve that metastable state, or it could happen the moment you give a metastable state a nucleation site. That energy is coming from all the interactions formed and lost (lost interactions with water, gained bonds between ions, in this case), so that energy comes only comes into play when it actually crystallizes. \n\nI'm not going to explain why crystallizing sodium acetate is exothermic here.

So in my mind it looks like this, heavy gasses trapped in atmosphere by gravity then hydrogen escapes from the ground and is less dense than all the other gasses so it speed up to a max velocity (think of a ballon filled with air under water). Then once it meets the edge of where there is less to no other gasses in the atmosphere it has to just push against gravity now and right there it glides right into space with ease.

You can see from this why you have to be going super fast to get any time dilation: small β means the denominator is about 1, meaning the whole Lorentz factor is about 1.

">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",Physics

"Agreed on false equivalence; I am not advocating MOND, or suggesting that it's a superior alternative to fit observational evidence -  we indeed have sufficient models for this. What I am suggesting however is that the largest technical breakthroughs in a theory tend to be ""hacks"" in the sense that, without a broader framework, they stitch together potentially disparate mathematical techniques in order to parsimoniously explain observations. This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it. Instead I am suggesting that these models hint at a deeper narrative we haven't grasped and that is reflected in their simplicity and disjointedness.",Physics

Get a pHD if you want to be treated well and afford rent. Bachelors level chemists are typically treated like grunts and get paid garbage for their first several years after college. Master’s level chemists are often looked at as “failed pHDs” unless they also have a lot of experience. The problem is that academic/theoretical chemistry experience at the B.S. level doesn’t give enough actual lab experience. So employers usually won’t trust you to run all the expensive instruments by yourself and you’ll require years of training to get to the point where they do. Therefore you’re unfortunately not worth that much to them yet.,Chemistry

"When the ball rebounds away from you the magnitude of the impulse (change in momentum) is the same for you and the ball but in opposite directions.\nImpulse is proportional to the mass and the change in velocity, which means the change in velocity is inversely proportional to the mass.\nYou have more mass than the ball (no offence), so your change in velocity is smaller than the ball's.\nNow the rebound happens over the same timeframe for both you and the ball, it is the duration of time where the ball is in contact with you during the rebound.\nAcceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it took to change.\nTherefore the acceleration is higher for the ball than it is for you, because the change in velocity is higher and it happens across the same timeframe.\n\nI hope that helps.

Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

"Well pardon me for still not understanding because im a real basic cyclist and high school physics person. But I have noticed in my observation there seems to be nothing related to counterbalancing the shift in the center of gravity. Remember the weight is always on the left handlebar. See your answer starts off with me tilting right to correct the center of gravity BUT the very instant i lift my hands off the handlebars from a well balanced moving bicycle, i can feel the bike start to progressively tilt right. It’s kind of like I feel an invisible force pulling me to the right\n\nEven more interestingly, i could tilt my body left first, while still holding the handlebar to balance, then lift my hands off and the bicycle will continue to cycle straight perfectly balanced. If i start off perfectly balanced and lift my hands off then the bicycle will start tilting to the right which after a set amount of tilt, I will start responding and leaning my body to the left to counter the tilt\n\nConsider this similar observation I made as well, when cycling without hands, if strong wind comes at me at 90 degrees from my right to left, my bike starts tilting right against the wind.

"As you already said, the Max Plank Foundation is huge. It has 86 institutes, does mostly fundamental science in basically everything (they have an institute for empirical aesthetics). The city I live in has three MPIs. I don’t work at one of those, but I do a PhD in physics in a similar institute. One of the other PhDs in my group did his master in the MPI on the other side of the road. He says working there was nice, but you need a proper work ethic (which you need anyway for a PhD). \nIn general, before starting a PhD you should find out who your direct supervisor is and who the professor you’re going to work under is. From my experience that’s often not the same person in the bigger institutes. So it’s good to make sure you can work with both of them. I would also recommend that you only start a PhD in a topic that really, really fascinates and intrigues you. Don’t start a PhD in something that has good job prospects but that doesn’t interest you. You will hate yourself for it a year in ;)\n\nGenerally MPIs have more money than university research groups (average, and I am speaking about German universities) so MPIs tend to have nice equipment. Payment is set according to the union Tarif for public institutions. Just the fraction of work time that you will be payed for can differ (mostly from 50% pay to 75%). That you’re from the US shouldn’t matter too much. The research community is generally more open and welcome than the country average, and that is not too bad in Germany (maybe with the exception of a few rural areas).\n\nWhich city is your MPI in?

From the object's point of view, something happened that caused him to emit sunlight back at the sun, meaning you can calculate what light it must have shone onto it that caused it to emit sunlight (sunlight + what it should absorb).

While I was in college, I didn't do any research and didn't form relationships with professors (which, in hindsight, was obviously pretty dumb). My grades were good, at least.\n\nSince graduating, I've been working in a lab in (I guess?) industry, doing mostly formulations-related stuff (largely in a box) as well as a couple of other projects in general. Although the work that I do on a daily basis is literally ""chemistry"" and literally ""research"", a lot of it is grunt work.

The pandemic has kind of encouraged me not to quit, at least in the short term.\n\nAnyway, would attempting to get into a master's program in chemistry be a good idea? Bad idea? Am I misunderstanding the concept of a master's altogether? Ignoring that I will again have to very awkwardly beg professors for the third professor-written letter of rec (who probably remembered me 4 years ago when I was first getting a job and asking but may not now), does the lack of specifically academic research hurt? Does the fact that chemistry was my minor and not my major hurt?

"O2 slowly going up when the blower is off is fairly normal. All boxes have a nonzero leak rate, but the catalyst can handle it as long as the air is circulating through it. In addition, the O2 sensor can be less accurate when the blower is off because their readings are sensitive to the gas flow around them.\n\nDoes the O2 only go up when the blower is on? I had a very similar problem in grad school. The issue turned out to be a problem in the regeneration line - the exhaust solenoid had an obstruction, and so it was always open. As a result oxygen could sneak in through the exhaust line and into the catalyst, but would only be able to get into the box and the sensors when air was circulating through the catalyst. I would check for leaks / flow problems in your regeneration line.",Chemistry

"This is a new proposal, fresh on the arXiv today, from a group of U.S. particle physicists. The introduction is very readable and lays out the mission clearly:\n\n> We can now confidently claim that the “Standard Model” of particle physics (SM) is established. At the same time, we are more and more strongly persuaded that this SM is incomplete. [...] It is now common to describe the SM as an “effective” theory that should be derived from some more fundamental theory at higher energies. But we have almost no evidence on the properties of that theory.\n\n> Our successes have become a liability in reaching this goal. Scientists from other fields now have the impression that particle physics is a finished subject. They question our motivations to go on to explore still higher energies. The scale of an energy frontier collider is also challenging to the young people in our field. They need to see qualitatively new capabilities realized during their active scientific careers. [...] That is where the urgency lies.\n\n> [T]he entire C3 program could be sited in the United States. With the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider and the end of Tevatron operations the US has largely abandoned construction of domestic accelerators at the energy frontier. C3 offers the opportunity to realize an affordable energy frontier facility in the US. This may be crucial to realize a Higgs factory in the near term, and it will also position the US to lead the drive to the next, higher energy stage of exploration.\n\nThe main innovation is that they propose to use _non_-superconducting cavities, which allow much higher accelerating fields, cooled to increase their quality factor. The resulting shorter length dramatically decreases the cost, to an estimated $4 billion, which is 80% to 90% less than other proposals. Of course, $4 billion is no small amount of money, but for perspective that's about equal to the monthly budget of the National Institutes of Health, a third of the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, or 2% of the total cost of the space shuttle.",Physics

"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics

"Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim? And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially. After looking more into it, I’m a little more skeptical. \n\nYou can see here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11) that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced. When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \n\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.",Physics

That's why not even collaborations like LIGO or detectors at CERN make raw data available, and publish only data that has been cooked medium-rare so that it can be further processed into physics that people are looking for (although, in case of those two examples, it's also because the data output depends on input of simulations).",Physics

"For me, biology was a lot of memorization in the first 5 classes or so, and chemistry was much more “learn a set of skills” and problem solve with them.\n\nNot sure why some people are telling you chemistry isn’t.  If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It’s very puzzle-like.  I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- it’s far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, I’m now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing I’ll say is that unlike in school, where you’re applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.  This is not true in chemistry research.\n\nHowever, in undergrad, it is if you understand chemistry.  There’s no feedback loop- you just use the rules you learned to approach and solve the problem they give you.\n\nEither way, good luck!",Chemistry

"I don’t think you’re all incorrect, I mean you’ve pointed out a huge flaw in quantum. Essentially the Copenhagen representation is just a shut up and calculate model so it’s difficult to comprehend conceptually. However, I do think you can view it as a probabilistic superposition for eigenstates, for example, the double slit experiment. If we observe the photons, then only go through one slit and we don’t really see a defraction grating but if we leave the system unobserved we see the wave/particle duality. This is when the particle goes through both slits. Actually Schrödinger’s cat was made by him as an example of how ridiculous the probabilistic approached QM is…but it actually is a good example which is ironic.

"You're just wrong. Yes, the excited vibrational modes can increase the kinetic energy of other molecules in the atmosphere, but CO2 definitely re-emits photons after the initial IR absorption. As with some of your thermodynamics arguments above, it seems like you know enough about some of these things to think that you're right and be able to give a plausible sounding argument, but it seems like you just lack some basic ideas about the specifics. CO2 really does re-emit the photon. Here's a simple link that explains this [fact](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-climate-works/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation#:~:text=Molecules%20of%20carbon%20dioxide%20\(CO,from%20infrared%20\(IR\)%20radiation.&text=The%20energy%20from%20the%20photon,by%20emitting%20another%20infrared%20photon.). Here's another [source](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/02/25/carbon-dioxide-cause-global-warming/). Beyond these very high level qualitative explanations that re-emission happens, you can also look at a physical chemistry textbook or a solid state physics textbook for a discussion of the interaction between photons and vibrational modes. Madelung's solid state physics book, for example calculates the rate of IR absorption, and you can calculate emission in an analogous way. His book might even do that derivation too, but I don't remember if it does since I read that section a while ago.",Physics

There's a couple of characteristics of a good catalyst IMO.\n\nSelectivity is one. Meaning it does the desired transformation 99% of the time or more. Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.,Chemistry

"Not the same molecules I'm working with but no other functional groups present should have any interference. I found two methods for selectively protecting a phenol in the presence of a primary alcohol - one with trityl (very difficult product to isolate and low yield) and one method doing a very similar transformation protecting with ethyl carbonate, mesylating the primary OH and reacting with DEA to add the amine and deprotect in one step. Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping. Maybe the DEA would be reactive enough on its own without additional base to promote substitution instead of elimination? Not sure.",Chemistry

"The journal doesn't normally analyse the data, they review the manuscript and the data that is presented. The way it works is that you submit a paper to a journal and the editor makes a decision on whether or not the paper should go to peer review. If yes, then the paper is sent to somewhere between one and three referees, who ideally are experts within the field, and who thoroughly scrutinize the manuscript and the presented results. That doesn't involve them re-analyzing the data, partially because that would simply be a too time consuming a process to have as a standard practice. Instead it is taken on good faith that the data was not fabricated (of course, patently absurd results would require more proof). One reason this is fine is because any result important enough to be replicated _will_ be replicated, and if other groups are unable to do so that will raise concern (which is what happened in this case). In very unique cases such as LIGO, where it's not feasible or even possible for other groups to replicate the results, more care has to be taken to ensure the authenticity of the results. In the case of LIGO, several of their recorded signals have been corroborated by radio-wave detection of the same events, which makes them more plausible.\n\nThe tl;dr is that a published article is not a stamp of truth, it's at best a stamp of rigor, but rigor is not infallible.",Physics

"The main problem is how we make them. We can make an atom or two at a time in a particle accelerator of basically all the super heavies, it's how we discovered basically all of them. We can also make macroscopic quantities up to Es or Fm in high neutron flux reactors (ie the HFIR at Oak Ridge). We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-µg scales. Even the recent Es paper relied on a single spectroscopy that has an exceptionally low detection limit (XAS) rather than the traditional inorganic chemistry tool of SC-XRD, which requires a single crystal, typically of 10µg or more total mass.",Chemistry

"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

"I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective.

That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution.

Since you know his mass, 77.1 kilograms, you can solve for his final velocity to determine his momentum upon hitting the ground - which is found by multiplying his mass by his final velocity. The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop.

"Method development.\n\nYou want to determine the limits of your titration.  That will be the Limit of Detection (LOD) which is the smallest amount of acetic acid you can detect.\n\nSecond is repeatability.  Take a big bottle of any type of acorbic acid at any concentration (but relevant to your experiment is best).  Homogenize it.  Split it into 10 equal or at least known masses.  Do the titration on those 10 samples and make a results table (include all results, even outliers).  Determine the standard deviation.  That's your experimental error.\n\nPotential error in your experiment is cleanliness.  Have you calibrated the DCPIP concentration with another known standard?  Are you maybe washing the DCPIP burette with water and subtly changing the concentration each time?  Ascorbic acid can oxidize in the air so you need to keep solutions stoppered and don't take hours to do the test.\n\nThe titration end point is very sharp, it's easy to overshoot.

Wouldn't it alter the results?\n\nWe can measure them, but it doesn't alter the result. Beta decay is a stochastic event. How long a neutron has existed in the past does not effect the probability that a neutron decays in the future. A free neutron that has existed for an hour has the exact same probability to undergo decay as a free neutron that has existed for a second. However, most free neutrons will never make it to that one hour mark before decaying.",Physics

Overall: the plastic has irreversibly lost a small part of itself but not enough to change the size of the brick.\n\nAdding peroxide + UV introduces more even stronger radicals - BAM! kick it up a notch.  They attack the yellow polymer only at the site that is missing a hydrogen atom and essentially chop it in half. No more yellow coloured molecule.\n\nDownside is the polymer is no longer elastic.  It's brittle.  What you un-intentionally end up doing is scraping off that tiny thin brittle layer to expose fresh plastic underneath.\n\nYou can repeat the process many times so long as you have material remaining.  It's almost exactly like sandpaper over a wooden floor to expose a fresh surface.  And yes, you can do it so many times but not infinite times.

">The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all.\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.   \n\nWhether any and all of this is done by burning fossil fuels (to generate the problem) and running renewably powered CO2-harvesters (to fix it) such as the prototype in Iceland, OR by decomposing plant and animal matter over thousands of years (the problem) and growing plants and algae (the fix) -- regardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back.  Whether this is done by just letting the winds blow over your adsorbant for 100 000 years, or by the flora growing for a 10 000, or by some array of turbines circling the planet and run by solar power for a thousand --- doesn't matter at all.  The fact remains that to reverse an irreversible process, you'll be spending at least the same amount of energy (and in practice, usually, much, much more). \n\nThere are many things that go into that confidence, understanding of the laws of thermodynamic being one, the ""sadly"" minute concentration of CO2 another (it would be much, much easier to process the N2 of our atmosphere, for example) -- we can even get to those if you like, but we simply *must* get around the *same* table before its even worthwhile.

Sure they teach you about bonds and elemental properties, but it's mostly oversimplified basics (which is harder to understand than if they explained in detail) and wet noodle you can live without. If you want to find out the best way is to find actual course material online. Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qTCy2wTL_s&list=PL2902385153144A26&index=10) I found on youtube that looks similar to my first lectures at uni. Find some interesting topics and see if you can follow. I am biased but the first year really isn't rocket science. It's more about whether or not you enjoy learning about it or not. Physical chemistry is cool but I don't really care about it. But I completed the courses and about to go into pharma (if all goes well) so it's whatever.

"I've read the other comments and at first I agreed, now I'm not so sure. The reaction doesn't set a temperature. Reactions have a heat associated. The temperature of the flame will be determined by the rate of heat production vs. heat transfer away.\n\nThe limit of course would be from if all the heat produced was only going into warming up the reaction products. If that is happening combining two streams gets you the same max temperature. But since some heat would immediately lost to surrounding air, having two flames in the area seems like it would mean less surrounding air to transfer heat to.\n\nWould it double the temperature, no. Increase, probably.\n\nNow if you could safely preheat the gasses in the second burner with the first, then it seems you could almost double the temperature. But this doesn't seem safe.\n\nReactions don't have a set final temperature, they have a set amt of heat released. If the matter heated and the matter reacted scale together the temp change will stay the same, otherwise it won't.",Chemistry

"You make some fair points, but I’m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won’t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn’t what you’re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I’m aware, I don’t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don’t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn’t be using fossil fuels for energy. I’m not a “clean coal” or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It’s not a fixed cost for every material. I can’t tell if I’m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren’t trying to “unburn the coal.” Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn’t coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don’t think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics

If we pick two points on the rope and imagine the tension we see the tension is much higher at the top as the rope is holding the mass of all the rope beneath it. If we look at a point at the bottom, the mass of rope applying tension is much less. Again, if we look at the forces applied to a single point on the rope we can see at the top the tension vector is very long in the negative direction in comparison to the horizontal force of the wind. The sum of those vectors faces almost completely down. As we continue to do so further down the rope we see the tension decreases and the ratio of that tension vector in comparison to the horizontal air force vector decreases and the total force vector points more in the direction of the horizontal force.",Physics

"I’m sorry. I don’t think you are considering the thermodynamics relevant to the situation. \n\nI don’t know what you mean by “filtering the atmosphere to get to the adsorption part.” The adsorption of CO2 is the same thing as the filtering. The point is to have an adsorbent that is selective for CO2 over other atmospheric gases. \n\nHere are two examples explaining why I don’t think your analysis is correct. First, rather than direct air capture people are working on capturing CO2 from a coal or natural gas flue stream. As mentioned in my previous comment, a coal plant will produce a good deal more CO2 than a natural gas plant will for the same amount of energy generated, but this actually doesn’t matter so much for the point I’m trying to make besides making it likely that you would want a different adsorbent material for the the two cases. If what you’re saying is correct, this work would be a completely pointless endeavor. In order to capture the CO2 from the fossil fuel plants, you would have to generate as much energy as they are generating with renewables. There would be no reason to do this if you were correct, yet this is a very active area of research that gets funding from the DOE and other sources. This is more of “proof by authority” than actually addressing your point with a physical argument, but I mention this because it’s one of the main reasons that I initially was skeptical of your claim. There are likely many hundreds or thousands of scientists currently working on, evaluating, and funding this type of research that your apparently simple argument based on the second law of thermodynamics renders pointless. It seems unlikely to me that so many people just haven’t considered this claim, especially since process modeling on the economic and materials cost of these materials is common as well and in that type of modeling, they develop sophisticated thermodynamic and kinetic models of CO2 capture in specific materials. They wouldn’t continue doing this if it were as simple as just having to input as much energy as you initially got out since then it would be a pointless task. \n\nThe second example is one I alluded to in my previous comment. Suppose in one case that all of our historical emissions were from coal plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_c. Suppose in another case that all of our emissions were from natural gas plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_n. In both cases there would be the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but E_n > E_c since natural gas emits less CO2 than coal for the same amount of energy generated.  By your argument, in these two scenarios, we would have to generate different amounts of energy to capture this carbon dioxide. This doesn’t make sense, however. Once the carbon dioxide is in the air, it doesn’t matter how it got there. We aren’t trying to turn the CO2 back into coal or back into natural gas. Instead we are trying to get it to bind to some material, and the energy required to make the material and unbind the CO2 later (if that’s required for storing it underground) will be fixed for the same material capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, regardless of the source of the CO2 initially. The material doesn’t care if the CO2 came from coal or a fire or from a person breathing. \n\nTo address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. After absorbing light it doesn’t permanently stay in an excited state. \n\nYour fart example misses the point again. The point of carbon capture isn’t to end up with coal or natural gas or whatever else as a byproduct of CO2 capture. The point is going from coal -> CO2 (and other things) -> CO2 bound to some material. It isn’t trying to make something a reversible process.",Physics

"First of all, it's not about the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere - it's about the *excess*, which is only about a third of that number (pre-industrial levels of atmospheric CO2 were 280 ppm, current levels are 420 ppm).\n\nSecondly, it isn't meant to be the ""one magic solution"" to solve all the CO2 problems in the world, it's about every bit that helps.\n\nAlso, equating that to an electricity price gives about [5 cents per kWh](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28100%24+per+metric+tonne%29+*+%280.475+kg%2FkWh%29) for using this method of carbon capture (based on the average emission of about 475 g per kWh worldwide), which is quite a bit (about a 10-20% price increase), but as worldwide energy production shifts to renewable sources, this price will also go down.",Physics

Not absurdly cheap, but apparently below the figure used for planning by some major companies, so this could be economically viable. \n\nThe problem is where the energy comes from.

Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway.

Really highly ionic salts like sulfates are barely soluble in anything but water. They will be slightly soluble in things like ethanol or methanol but the problem with them is they are quite unstable (electrochemically speaking) which means you won't be able to reach high voltages at all.\n\nAlso going to non-aqueous immediately introduces the problem of water sensitivity, your salts will likely be wet and even if you do find a cheap solvent that will dissolve the salts in a desirable concentration then it too will suck up water from the atmosphere over time which can have an effect on performance (again reducing voltage stability)",Chemistry

"> using vinegar to clean greasy ovens and microwaves\n\nIt's a mild cleaning option.  Perfect for some uses - too slow for others.\n\nThe grease in your oven is mostly food oils.  So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.

Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes.

"In quantum field theory (which we know to work pretty damn well), in principle there are certain processes that are allowed to happen. Those processes are called ""Charge-Parity symmetry violating"". There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\n\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

Therefore, the only things that could travel at that universal speed limit would be massless objects. As photons do not have mass, they must therefore travel at that universal speed limit in a vacuum. The universal speed limit isn't defined by the speed of light but the other way around.",Physics

"Why would this be a process you attempt in situ? You're telling me you'll design an entirely new nuclear reactor based entirely on the idea that it might maybe form something somewhat beneficial? I mean, you're talking about introducing a fuel rod, a reflector and a gas  into a reactor. Just with fuel rod and reflector, you would at a minimum need to completely overhaul a reactor to swap it out to your newly designed fuel rod and reflector. Plus you'd need to introduce a gas stream into the system which gets very complicated. Cooling efficiency would change dramatically... so... I really don't see any other option than complete redesign. I'm also not sure what you're doing about cladding. Every fuel rod I know of is encased in a cladding material that would prevent the formation of the uranium nitride you want since that uranium is not exposed to the NH3. I'm willing to bet that a basic solution is not ideal for the system, either. \n\nI don't know the decay chains of everything so I'll just take your word that a neutron will create 15-N. Presumably that will be most efficient at a certain neutron velocity so why wouldn't you take a nitrogen source to something like a spallation neutron source or just another reactor (there's a few designed as neutron sources) where you can convert it to 15-N with significantly higher efficiency?

It’s like when you leave  a full cup of water sit for a long period of time - where the water level used to be - but is no longer - there is a white film. That’s those dissolved solids. Probably safe for drinking. I would try adding a little vinegar - top off with water - let sit for a while - dump, rinse, dry with a cloth",Chemistry

"Hi so I’m currently living in NYC. I am a current college student getting a Computer Science and Information Security degree. I have taken a great interest in both machine learning and physics. I was wondering what should I do for a masters? I am interested in neural networks and how it can be applied to particle physics. Another area I’m interested in is AI safety. If anyone has a recommendation of a grad school or a masters degree where I can pursue this, preferably in NYC let me know. Also I have a 3.0 gpa, for grad school would this be enough to get in, or do I have to get a 3.5?",Physics

"Consider a vertical cryogenic liquid storage tank (say liquid nitrogen) where the pressure in the vapour space is 1000 kPa. Liquid nitrogen is supplied out of this tank, from an outlet at the bottom of the tank. No pump, just liquid decant/gravity fed out. I understand the liquid at the outlet is subject to a force according to the height of liquid above it (and density, gravity). \n\n- To what degree does the 1000kpa of pressure in the vapour space affect the liquid that is 'pushed out' the bottom outlet? Does this pressure apply a force on liquid below the surface at all? \n- if we consider the liquid level height and the vapour pressure as variables, which will be a more significant factor in how 'quickly', or with how much force the liquid is pushed out the bottom?\n\nIt's been a few years since uni and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. I keep thinking intuitively if you put a second outlet just below the surface level of the liquid, I would expect the flow out of this to be less than the flow out the bottom. But I can't find a way to separate the forces/show that the liquid head is the determining factor. I tried to calculate the liquid height force (rho*g*h) and compare to the force due to pressure of the gas, but the gas pressure came out much larger lol.\n\nIs it simply that the vapour pressure only acts on the surface boundary and below that the 'pressure' on the liquid is due to the liquid height?\n\nThanks!!",Physics
You’re right- it might have been ether.  It’s been 7-8 years- I do think you’re right about the solvent though.\n\nI never liked adding the anti-solvent first because it was difficult to guess what level the anti-solvent should be at without the inner vial in already.

">my teacher said that if an object were to reach 0º Kelvin then the matter would cease to exist.\n\nThe unit is K for Kelvin, not °K.\n\nA general rule in math which is also widely applicable in physics is, that if you assume something, which is wrong or in violation of general principles of nature you can basically deduct anything from that. Those deductions are neither true nor false but mostly meaningless.\n\nFor all we know, it is not possible to cool an object to 0 K.
