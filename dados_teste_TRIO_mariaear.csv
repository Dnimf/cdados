"Chemically Modified Cellulose (CMC) thickeners can be massively improved as binders compared to native starch... or massively reduced in their ability to bind.  It really depends on what it was modified with and for what purpose.\n\nGenerally, I'll always pick a CMC thickener for an industrial formulation.  It's just better in almost every way, definitely less batch-batch variation.  Downside is they are less readily available for home users and can have slightly higher skills to use correctly.\n\nEven more fun, different sources of natural starch show varying properties.

"Well it kinda depends on geometry but likely what is happening is that, you need to lean the bike hard to the right to keep the contact patch under the offset center of gravity, and that lean angle combined with the fork's offset forces the wheel to steer right. Fork offset changes steer angle in a lean - if there were no offset on the fork, the wheel would just flop to the side when driving straight because with a slackened steering axis, the wheel is actually at it's highest point when pointed straight, and 90 degrees to the direction of travel is it's lowest point. Due to the castor effect, fork offset causes the wheel to point forward when the bike is upright, but also causes the fork to self-steer into a lean due to the offset from the steering axis. A fork with zero offset would tend to point out of a turn while leaning. \n\nTL;DR: Bag is heavy on one side. Lean other direction to balance center of gravity.

"Yes, top research jobs usually go to PhD and ScDs.  AS degreed applicants are usually hired as technicians.  BS chemists are sort of caught in the middle.

But not so obvious is that if you can play the violin, you will be irresistible to a lab where there is already a cellist and a pianist.  A chemist who plays golf will have an advantage in a company with a golf culture.  Third, use your computer skills.  Research companies and institutions and their employees and management for intelligence and places where your interests are a fit.  If you are a bowler, find organizations with a bowling team or league. Target or retarget nearby chemist employers.  Locate the bar nearest to the lab and frequent it at lunch time.

"Thallium possesses several closed shells of d and f-electrons, but once they are completely filled they tend to become irrelevant. (hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed. It may be possible that stuff like CsTl exists, but I would not bet on it.",Chemistry

Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.

"This is wrong, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWe know a ton about DM and it is not a placeholder for anything. We know how much of it there was at the point of last scattering due to precision measurements of the CMB's temperature temperature correlation (as well as from polarization information). We also know how much there was due to measurements of the abundances of light elements. It is because these two measurements agree that we *really* believe that DM is what we think it is. But we also know its radial profile in galaxies, that it doesn't interact with regular matter much, that it doesn't interact with itself much, that it clumps, that this clumpiness dictates the large scale structure of the universe, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. All of these things point to a self consistent picture of a cold fluid that has thermally evolved like matter and has been present in corresponding densities since the very early universe.\n\nA lot of non-physicists have this idea that DM is just rotation curves and nothing else. That is *not* why we believe DM exists, although it is one more data set that points to a consistent picture, and it is the first data set pointing towards DM, but far from the most precise.\n\nAs for DE, it is also not a placeholder. We see that we have recently (a few billion years ago) entered into a DE dominated era where the evolution of the Hubble parameter is increasingly dominated by DE. The primary data set for this is type 1a SNe. While this data set is tricky, there are a large number of independent checks of DE, notably intrinsic curvature. In addition, we have looked for higher order moments in the acceleration of the universe and not found any, suggesting that DE is what we think it is. Finally, we know that the equation of state of DE is close to -1 as expected from the cosmological constant.\n\nWhat is going on right now in these areas? Many things. For DM, people are using the open data from experiments like GAIA to detect substructures in the galactic DM halo, which is mind boggilingly awesome. As for DE, with upcoming experiments like Vera Rubin we will increase our SNe data set by orders of magnitude.\n\nFinally, the dark sector mentioned in this article isn't the same as dark energy or dark matter, although it could be. Despite the fact that these names all sound related and very vague - dark sector, dark matter, dark energy - they are distinct things. The article is about neutrinos and an anomaly at 4.8sig that just got weirder: obvious explanations don't work so people are turning to less obvious things. This is the way discoveries work. Something strange happens in the data (MiniBooNE sees an excess), the simplest interpretation is investigated (a sterile neutrino), so follow up experiments are built to robustly test this. MicroBooNE just reported their first test of MiniBooNE's excess and, in a different kind of experiment, they don't see it. But the MiniBooNE result has been checked to hell and back, it is pretty hard to believe that it is just an experimental problem, although it could be. Thus people are considering new physics scenarios other than sterile neutrinos and these scenarios often go under the umbrella term of dark sector, although it's a pretty shit name just like dark matter and dark energy.",Physics

And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there.

"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.",Chemistry

"But the counterintuitiveness is not yet answered as the downward force on the left side due to the added weight doesnt seem to be balanced by me having to lean left. In any case i should all the more topple left intuitively because i am having to literally lean left with the weight added on the left of the bike \n\nOkay consider a frame by frame analysis, what happens when the weight on the left side of the handlebar causes the handlebar to rotate left and the bicycle trajectory to curve towards the left. My body was still travel in a straight line due to inertia. From the bike’s perspective my body’s center of gravity would no longer be centered on the seat and tires and would start to cause a torque which tilts the bicycle right. The tilt causes the handlebar to then straighten out which aligns the bike’s trajectory to my body’s and therefore the bicycle continues on forward. But what’s left behind is the tilt, still being uncorrected and so I have to counterbalance counterintuitively to my left on the same side as the added weight so the bike doesnt topple as it is travelling straight ahead",Physics

"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter. It says so right on the 2nd page of their paper:\n\n> Consider requirement (iii), that is, successful cosmology. In (2) we have a new d.o.f. φ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(−3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their φ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren’t trying to do away with dark matter at all — their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter.",Physics

At t=0+, when the valve is opened, the water is pulled up, but that force actually acts both ways, trying to equalize the pressure, and thus 'pulling' on the space end of the tube. This makes sense because space is not a 100% true vacuum, there are still some particles, but they are so sparse that the pressure is effectively 0.  Since space is infinitely more massive than water in the tube, it will seem like a unidirectional force and thus 'free energy', even though the system is trying just as hard to suck the sparse particles in as to push water up. Moving the water just ends up being infinitely easier, and thus the outcome that ends up occuring.",Physics

When burned, the fuel exhaust has less energy coming from a rocket that is moving quickly than it would at rest (since you subtract the rocket’s velocity from the rest exhaust velocity to get the actual exhaust velocity).  When a rocket is moving quickly, the rocket is extracting more kinetic energy from the fuel than it does at rest (as seen from an outside observer).\n\nKeep in mind that chemical energy rockets do not follow F=ma, and their acceleration is not constant nor proportional to their instantaneous mass (the actual equation is F = m * dV/dt + dm/dt * V, though if the fuel mass flow is small compared to the rocket mass, F=ma is pretty dang close).",Physics

Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory. Like Heath Ledger's Joker could be argued to be level 2 like a pleasure seeking child as well as he could be argued to be a transcendent level 6 with his own higher moral code. But I think it's a fun place to start.",Physics

"Much of chemistry is mixing two different things together that have never been mixed together to try to make some new compound. Chemists have a baseline understanding of reactivity and use that knowledge to set up experiments to make some molecule or another. We learn in classes, researching primary literature, and our own experiments how things react.\n\nExample- today I had a methyl ester I wanted to convert to a carboxylic acid. As far as I'm aware, no one has ever made this ester compound I was working with. However, I know that many esters react with aqueous hydroxide ions to make carboxylic acids (technically the carboxylate ion). I stirred my methyl ester around with some lithium hydroxide in water and a little methanol and got the product I wanted.\n\nConfirming what the product is depends on the compound. I was able to determine the identity of the molecule using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There are a lot of analytical tools to identify products of reactions out there.",Chemistry

"To calculate it you should probably work backwards, start with the neutralization reaction, then the reaction to produce the nitric acid (I think it's the Ostwald process). Make sure to balance the equations. \n\nBy using the yield of the Ostwald process you can find the ratio of ammonia for the nitric acid to the ammonia used in the final reaction.\n\nThen you should convert the molar ratios into mass ratios (between the ammonia and the ammonium nitrate).\n\nThis should hopefully work. I wasn't quite sure how much you might of forgotten so I just brain dumped my thought process. I might check this calculation on paper to see if I've forgotten any steps  or made a mistake.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter actually checking the molar ratio of the Ostwald process it appears that I overcomplicated it.\n\nAs the Ostwald process is 1:1 (ammonia:nitric acid) the whole process takes 2 ammonia for 1 ammonium nitrate.\n\nSo you can calculate the mass of the product by just getting the moles of ammonia dividing by 2 and then multiplying by the molar mass of ammonium nitrate.",Chemistry

"It’s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn’t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth’s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I’m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren’t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn’t have replaced oil. It also wasn’t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don’t make a compelling case for why we shouldn’t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

Aluminium doesn't form covalent compounds only either, but let's say even in ionic compounds it is trivalent. \n\nLike Sea\_Wind\_2705 said, it's just a simplified rule according to one theory. More accurate theories are more complicated and are not taught at high school level (only rarely for those that compete).",Chemistry

"Well that's what I'm asking. Under the right conditions can nitrogen-14 accept a neutron to become nitrogen-15 without losing the proton and becoming carbon-14? Nitrogen-14 captures neutrons that uranium-238 could be capturing to become fissile plutonium-239 after undergoing beta-decay, leading to decreased efficiency. \n\nBut actually that's precisely why it'd be inefficient if nitrogen-15 could be made by neutron capture in a reactor. The more energy put out from uranium nitride with a N-15 isotope over uranium dioxide would be lost making the N-15 from N-14 in the reactor. So It'd be stupid anyway. I was just thinking in basic chemistry knowledge, that maybe the nitrogen had something to do with its enthalpy, not too much about the nitrogen blocking uranium-238 capturing a neutron. But then that leads to more questions... Nevermind lol.\n\nI think uranium nitride with just plain old nitrogen-14 would produce more energy in a reactor than the uranium dioxide since there's more uranium in the crystal lattice, right?

"Welcome to this puzzling problem set  \nI am currently doing a reaction in the lab, where I am working with a molecule that contains the moiety shown above.  \nUpon treatment with base (Carbonate Buffer at ph 9 and 10 as well as in DMF with DIPEA) there are peaks/masses appearing on the LCMS and also it seems like the cleavage of the Thioester just stagnates after a certain point because first the peak starts decreasing and then it just remains...which is weird because I would expect the Thioester to be fully degraded) \n\n   \n**b:** shows the molecule upon treatment: the thioester is cleaved and the thiol is freed (I also see the mass of the disulfide of b)\n\n  \n**c:** shows the mass of my product without the acetyl-protecting group on the amine. This is something I find super surprising – why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so…super stable? Also, I expect c to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (shown in d). They do have the same mass   \n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of **b** and **d**. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture, this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory   \n  \n**So:  1. why is there a deacetylation happening in the first place?**\n\n2. Is there maybe another shift I don’t know of between Amides and thioesters?\n\n  \n  \nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to **a** except they don’t have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an Amine *in this position* at all, so actually it would be counterintuitive that these byproducts happen because of an S-N Acylshift because there is no N close to the S in the other molecules). Still, they all show these weird masses.   \nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen?   \nCould the secondary Amine (the one next to the phenyl) participate in this reaction (because this secondary amine is also present in all of the three substrates)   \nI am very confused by the outcome of this reaction and any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!",Chemistry

What if the answers to these paradoxes are so complex and abstract that they’re hidden in higher realms of science that we are nowhere near yet? \n\nI feel the same way about quantum mechanics as well as physics in general.

"Within the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons are part of a group of particles called leptons, which also includes the electron's heavier brothers the muon and the tauon, and their respective neutrinos. Electrons differ from muons and tauons only in mass: their charge and other fundamental properties are exactly the same.\n\nWe expect that the muon, being a heavier lepton, will decay into an electron over time, as will the tauon, which can decay into a muon or an electron. Importantly however, the Standard Model predicts that the decay rate from a tauon to an electron should be the same as the decay rate from a muon to an electron, up to a factor of their masses. As all the other properties between muons and tauons are the same, only their *mass* can affect the decay rate. This is called *lepton universality*, and it basically means that leptons only differ from each other in their mass, and interactions cannot depend on their flavor.\n\nA test of lepton universality is to take very heavy mesons, like the B meson (which contains a bottom quark), and observe its decay. B mesons will decay into K mesons by having their bottom quark decay into a strange quark, and this decay is mediated by the weak force, which allows coupling to leptons. Lepton universality then allows us to predict how many muons vs tauons we expect to see when these decays happen, and a couple of years ago we found a 2-3σ deviation from the theory, suggesting that lepton universality is not correct. This deviation was not large enough however to warrant a claim of ""new physics"" having been observed, for that we would need a >5σ detection.\n\nThe new results from LHCb repeat this 2-3σ deviation. It's consistent, but still not sufficient for new physics.",Physics

"Yes, you are measuring things.  Two differing reference frames, time, and The speed of the bullet in those reference frames, For starters.\n\nHow they get ""synced together"" (not a good phrase, but I'm going with it) isn't by doubling the speed of the bullet.  It is by using a Lorentz Transformation.  When the above posters talk about blue shifted light coming from the bullet this is related.  Due to the nature space-time warping at relativistic speeds the energies involved become a hindrance thus creating a cost for objects of mass in typical space-time system where they can't reach c.  As it creates an asymptotic energy cost to reach c.  Leaving us with a situation where it would look to the observer always less than c.  \n\nSo the observer would see, as you correctly said, the bullet travel from the gun to them in 10 seconds.  \n\nBut\n\nThe bullet would take a different time, differing reference frames and all that.  \n\nSo how do we rectify the two?  Which is where I think your question lies.  \n\nEvery time step (1 sec) light or some bit of information leaves the bullet AT the speed of light and reaches the observer.  It will always reach them first.  So, for the entire trip light is signaling the arrival of the bullet before the bullet in the bullets reference frame to the observer in the observers reference frame.  And since the bullet only goes 0.5c (and none faster) those bits of photons going c tell us the bullet never went c, regardless of how we experienced it.  \n\nLuckily we have blue shift and other measurements to tell us this rather accurately.  Because if we see, hear, feel, the bullet we have measured it.",Physics

In my experience, the top candidates are often already employed by the time I saw at their applications, so I work down the stack until I get a manageable number of interviewees. \n4. If no suitable candidate is available, then they advertise the job and restart the process. \n\nOther places handle it differently, reaching out to their network of colleagues to find promising students or recent graduates.

"For comparison, we could look to beta plus decay. A free proton will never decay because such a process is energetically banned, but bound inside a nucleus, this becomes possible because the energy situation has changed (the mass of the daughter nucleus is less than that of the mother, since nuclear mass is a complex function of number of protons and neutrons). So, similar idea here. The energy conditions strongly suppress or outright ban neutron decay in the star, which can also happen for various nuclei.

"As some others said, it looks like silver nitrate being added to potassium chromate. Silver chromate is the orange precipitate.",Chemistry
Any advantage of this versus a koffler apparatus ?,Chemistry
"For oscillation between 3 flavour states, there needs to be 3 non-degenerate mass eigenstates. The frequency of oscillation is proportional to the difference in mass between these states, which have been measured. We just don't know the absolute scale of the masses.",Physics
Incredible precision achieved !,Physics
Second this!\n\nOr maybe a variant of the sun-down reaction but i would guess u/IntelligentUmpire42 is right.\n\nEdit: sun-down reaction - Silver(I)-ions react with thiosulfates to white precipitate that shifts to red and then black,Chemistry
No. Just fucking no.,Chemistry
"A molecule is the ""smallest part into which a substance can be divided without destroying its chemical character"" according to Amedeo Avogadro (1811), who first applied the word to chemistry.\n\nIUPAC is a political organization subject to both the tyranny of the majority and linguistic decay. The document you linked sources from a *recommendations* document. It's sad that it gets something this simple this wrong, but it's probably not the only error in there.",Chemistry
"If the immune system interests you, Philipp Dettmers new book ""Immune"" is one of the few books that actually ticks all these boxes.",Chemistry
Alright thanks,Chemistry
"Maybe another way to describe the idea, (that I get is way out there) what if time on earth in our solar system passes at a rate which is different to the rate on an exact copy of earth and our solar system but in a galaxy which is not a rotating galaxy. If that time difference would be directly correlated to the amount of space-time that the planet is passing through. The spinning Galaxy (ours) would be moving through more gravitational fields than the other.\n\nFrom what I think we understand about space-time space-time is not a ""medium"" but gravitational field of waves which we exist within and move through. The faster you move through space, the faster the time moves. The slower, the slower time moves is the theory.",Physics
Fuck pchem.,Chemistry
Continous amount of steps.,Physics
You didn't monitor you deprotection step by TLC or GLC.  That would be an obvious place to start debugging.,Chemistry
"For a speaker for music, you probably want a curved bell like a wind instrument.  Sharp sides could affect the different frequencies differently, which could lower the sound quality.  A curved end should make the variations smaller.",Physics
"😁 I’ll curiously await his next experiment with a pulsed laser diode - seems that a femtosecond laser is expensive, unless he can convince an ophthalmologist- or fluorescent light source so to avoid the coherent beams of the laser he was using now. Very interesting.",Physics
No.,Physics
I'm trying to adapt a DBSCAN algorithm to automatically count stuff in fluorescence pics for some biologers.,Physics
When a ball is rolled off a horizontal cliff it has no initial vertical velocity but does have horizontal velocity (which stays the same throughout its flight). \n\nWhen it lands it has the same horizontal velocity added to the new vertical velocity (as it has been accelerating downward over the entire flight). \n\nThis totalled velocity vector will have a direction that is not vertical.,Physics
Job of cleaning moldy shower,Chemistry
"So, we're looking at different sub-processes.  You deal with the adsorption -- and I agree, we don't need to be producing fuels with energy density that is equal to what we originally burned, to obtain our goal.  \nMy original point is ""just"" about the filtering of our atmosphere so we could even get to the adsorption part.  \n\n\n>Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim?\n\nIn short, unrestrained expansion of a fluid is an [irreversible process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process).  So is the heat exchange through a finite temperature difference (ie. cooling of the exhaust).  So is the mixing of two substances.  All are involved when the exhaust is let out into the atmosphere. \n\nOn top of that, by virtue of CO2 being a *greenhouse gas*, it's readily absorbing additional energy from sunlight. \n\nIf it were possible to re-collect the fart back to where it came from using less energy (provided originally by your body in the form of heat and pressure of the gas) than went into releasing the fart(\*), you could perpetually heat your apartment by farting.\n\n(\*) With real combustion of hydrocarbons, not all of the energy released goes into expanding and mixing the exhaust with the atmosphere -- of course, otherwise a campfire wouldn't feel warm, or the car wouldn't move.",Physics
Not if pure ethanol,Chemistry
Yes it’s the same concept as ohms law but you would have to have Resistance or another factor to get you to the point that you can make the equation for a final answer,Physics
"It’s both. It’s written by an organic chemist and includes structural information. It’s more chemically oriented than the layman’s disappearing spoon, but also focuses on how the discovery of and understanding of the featured molecules changed the world as we know it. I read it in grad school originally on the recommendation of a fellow student. All of my cohort eventually read it and we all enjoyed it.\n\nYou can probably find a copy at a library to skim through to see if it meets what you’re looking for.",Chemistry
Lol.. No perpetual motion. Just a difference of pressure to let an airfilled container sink or float in water. You use a bit of energy to move a lot of water trough a pipe. This is just a simple version that shows the principle.,Physics
